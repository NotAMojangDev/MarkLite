# MarkLite

This was my CS50 Final Project for cs50x 2023 (I forgot to upload it to github)
Good news, I did get a certificate.
anyway: 

In order to build this from source run:
**use `npm install` or use your chosen package manager before running the build commands**
Windows - `npm run build-win`
Darwin (OSX or MacOS) - `npm run build-mac`
Linux - `npm run build-linux`
